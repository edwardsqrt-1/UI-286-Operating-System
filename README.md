# UI-286-Operating-System
This is a simple operating system for some of the oldest PCs that have long since been abandoned support by modern operating systems such as Linux and in some cases some BSD distributions. While it is not intended to be a UNIX-like system, many commands will be more familiar to said systems such as the `ls` and `cd` commands for example.
